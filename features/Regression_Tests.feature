Feature: Run regression tests against the soltuiin
  I Want to run regression tests against the soltion 
  So that I can confirm that the solution still functions as expected

  Background:
    Given I am an external user
      And I have a valid "rma" username and password
      And I create a new proposal
      And I enter a project name

  Scenario Outline: Submit a new proposals with a funding source
    Given I select a project type "<project_type>"
      And I select a financial year to stop spending
      And I add a location "<location>"
      And I upload a benefit area file "<shapefile>"
      And I enter a business case start date
      And I enter a award contract date
      And I enter a construction start date
      And I enter a ready for service date
      And I enter a funding source for "<funding_source>"
      And I enter funding values for "<funding_source>" previous year "<previous>", 2015-2016 "<2015-2016>", 2016-2017 "<2016-2017>", 2017-2018 "<2017-2018>", 2018-2019 "<2018-2019>", 2019-2020 "<2019-2020>"
    When I check the proposal overview page
    Then I should see the total estimated spend as "<total_spend>"
      And I should see the funding source contributor "<funding_source>"

    Examples:
      |project_type|location|shapefile|funding_source|previous|2015-2016|2016-2017|2017-2018|2018-2019|2019-2020|total_spend|

      And I add my main project risk "tidal"
      And I add the flood protection outcome as none
      And I add the standard of protection before project starts as "very_significant_risk"
      And I add the standard of protection after project completes as "low_risk"
      And I enter the projects goal approach "QA: Full proposal to check project not urgency with rma user"
      And I enter environmental outcomes improvements
      And I select the project urgency as "not_urgent"
      And I upload a project funding calculator file for option "No", "PFCalcVs8.xlsx"
      And I select the confidence page
      And I add the confidence in number of homes better protected by this project as "high"
